### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Variable declaration - This was easy because its the same for Python and C++. I got a lot of practice with this because I had to do it in every exercise.
2. All kinds of loops - I've been working with loops for almost two years now. There were a lot of exercises where I could practice these loops, and they are very similar to C++.
3. Control structures - I had to use condition statements often in my exercises. These were also similar to C++, so I was already very familiar with them.
4. Most operators - Working with every operator except for ! was easy. They're the same in Python and C++, so they were easy to use.
5. HTML design - I enjoyed designing my own websites, although it was a bit tricky to learn everything at first. Now its easier thanks to the bonuses on button making etc.
   
### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Functions - Sometimes I still find it difficult to make my own functions. There are also a lot of things I can do with built-in functions, which I want to play around with.
2. Input/Output - There are many different ways to input and output, which I only practiced a little bit, such as alert windows and getting input from websites.
3. Arrays - Using/making arrays in a code still confuses me sometimes, especially when I learned there are new ways to populate them that I didn't know from C++.
4. Syntax - Javascript is very similar to C++, so I still think of it in a C++ way. Some of the syntaxes need getting used to.
5. ! Operator - Code reading with the ! operator sometimes confuses me, since my codes normally don't look like the ones in quizzes / tests.
   
### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Find more exercises online
2. Try and solve the exercises
3. Keep practicing

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Effective:
1. Graded Exercise 2 - It helped me understand getElementById, which I needed to use for the following exercises.
2. Loops bonus activities - These refreshed me on using loops, which were important for the LT.

Ineffective:
1. Graded Exercise 7 - This one was kind of hard for me because it was debugging a code that I didn't write. I just feel like its ineffective because its not our own code that we're debugging.
2. I don't really think any other exercise was ineffective because I definitely learned a lot from all of them.
