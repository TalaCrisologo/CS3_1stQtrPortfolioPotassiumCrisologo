## **Reflections**
### **by Tala Crisologo // 9 - Potassium**

### **What did you learn or got some practice on? ━━━━━━━━━━━**
L1. I was able to practice the syntax of for loops.
L2. I was able to learn how to push elements into arrays. I also practiced how to use for loops to populate arrays.
L3. I was able to practice adding elements into arrays, and I also learned how to prevent duplicating letters. This was a bit difficult to think of at first, but I was able to do it.

### **Final Reflection ━━━━━━━━━━━**
1. **What’s one thing you learned about loops this quarter?**
   * I learned that do while loops are guaranteed to run the code block once. This was interesting because I didn't really use this loop last year, and I didn't know that. 
   * Learning how to do loops in JS. The syntax is similar to C++, but there are more possibilities, which means that I also have to learn what the language/syntax is able to do.

2. **How do arrays make your code more powerful?**
   * There are many things that you can do with arrays. It organizes data or values, and makes it easier to print/access. Because I have arrays, I don't have to keep printing a word or a value. I could just use a loop and the index of the element.

3. **What’s one feature you’d add if you had more time?**
   * For my final code (the guessing game) I'd make a code that gets random words from an array after every completed word.
